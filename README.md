# Personal Data Visualisation Projects in Python and R
This repository displays my person data visualisation projects in Python and R. 

It aims to demonstrate my Python and R skills and experiences with data visualisation for my employers and colleagues, and I look forward to feedback on how I can improve visualisation skills and optimise coding writing in Python and R.

The following list categorises my data visualisation projects by topic and theme with direct links to original codes and visualisations.
